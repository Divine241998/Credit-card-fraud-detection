In this project, I used Logistic Regression as my model and it yielded a 99.9% Accuracy score and a 0.66 F1 score. The dataset used in training this model had an imbalanced target feature which can easily cause overfitting. If the F1 score had gone below 0.5, i would have oversampled the minority class to tackle the imbalanced target feature.

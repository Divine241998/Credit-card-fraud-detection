In this project, I used Logistic Regression as my model and it yielded a 99.9% Accuracy score and a 0.66 F1 score. It was seen that, the dataset used in training this model had an imbalanced target feature which could have easily caused an overfitting. If it had, and the F1 score had gone below 0.5, i would have oversampled the minority class to tackle the imbalanced target feature.

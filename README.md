In this project, I used Logistic Regression as my model and it yielded a 99.9% Accuracy score and a 0.66 F1 score. The dataset used has an imbalanced target feature which can easily cause overfitting; although, it didn't in this case. If the F1 score had gone below 0.5, i would have oversampled the minority class to tackle the imbalanced target feature.
